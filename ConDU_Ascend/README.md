# Enhanced Continual Learning of Vision-Language Model

This is the official implementation of paper "[Enhanced Continual Learning of Vision-Language Models with Model Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10705)". We propose Continual Decoupling-Unifying (ConDU), a novel approach, by introducing model fusion into continual learning for VLMs. ConDU maintains a unified model along with task triggers and prototype sets, employing an iterative process of decoupling task-specific models for previous tasks and unifying them with the model for the newly learned task.

## Environment Setup

~~~bash
conda create -n ConDU python=3.10 -y
conda activate ConDU
pip install -r requirements_ascend.txt
~~~

and pleas download and install torch_npu from Ascend-pytorch(https://gitee.com/ascend/pytorch/releases) and pip install the corresponding torch version.

## Dataset Preparation

We follow the setting of **Multi-domain Task Incremental Learning (MTIL)** Benchmark. There are 11 required datasets to be donwloaded and placed as following structure. The `data` folder should be placed in the parent directory of this project (`../data`). You can refers to [datasets.md](../data/datasets.md) for more details.

## Training Stage 

If you want to replicate our results in the paper, you can directly run the corresponding scripts to finish the training stage. 
- For benchmark MTIL and task-agnostic MTIL, run `bash scripts/MTIL_FT.sh` to use the method ConDU (FT) or run `bash scripts/MTIL_LoRA.sh` to use the method ConDU (LoRA)
- For benchmark few-shot MTIL, run `bash scripts/fewshot_MTIL_FT.sh` to use the method ConDU (FT) or run `bash scripts/fewshot_MTIL_LoRA.sh` to use the method ConDU (LoRA)


## Evaluation Stage

If you want to replicate our results in the paper, you can directly run the corresponding scripts to finish the evaluation stage. 
- For benchmark MTIL and fewshot MTIL, run `bash scripts/eval_MTIL_FT.sh` to evaluate the method ConDU (FT) or run `bash scripts/eval_MTIL_LoRA.sh` to evaluate the method ConDU (LoRA)
- For benchmark task-agnostic MTIL, run `bash scripts/eval_agnostic_MTIL_FT.sh` to evaluate the method ConDU (FT) or run `bash scripts/eval_agnostic_MTIL_LoRA.sh` to evaluate the method ConDU (LoRA)
